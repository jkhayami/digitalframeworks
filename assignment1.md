### [How far has U.S. manufacturing employment fallen](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/04/alex-mooney/how-far-has-us-manufacturing-employment-fallen/)

I thought this Politifact piece was quite interesting because it is using data to correct statistics found in another article. U.S. Rep Alex Malooney from West Virginia wrote in a Wall Street Journal [op-ed](https://www.wsj.com/articles/steel-and-aluminum-lets-talk-about-gold-1522005011) that "from 2000-10, U.S. manufacturing employment shrank by a third after holding steady for 30 years." This Politifact article said that Malooney did not consider population growth when analyzing manufacturing employment statistics. While his raw data was correct, without the context of population growth, it depicted an inaccurate picture. 

* I liked that this article used a chart to depict data because I find that numbers can be much easier to digest when in visual form. First, the article showed the raw data of "U.S. manufacturing employment from 1970-2018" that Malooney used in bar graph form. They credited the data to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but did not link to the source. 

* They then showed a bar graph which represented "U.S. manufacturing employment as a percentage of U.S. population from 1970-2018." This graph showed that there was a significant decrease in manufacturing employment in the U.S., contradicting Malooney's claim that it stayed consistent.

* The piece went on to analyze West Virginian manufacturing employment. They did not, however, show this in the same type of bar graph that they used for the other data. The West Virginia data is interesting because the manufacturing employment was consistent between 1990 - 2000, but significantly fell between 2000 and 2010, but has since remained steady. I wonder if this affected Malooney's decision to write the op-ed, as he is from West Virginia. However, in his WSJ article, he did not speak specifically about West Virginia, and only the U.S. as a whole.

Overall, I think this article did a good job using data to analyze another article that used data. This piece was good for me to read as a student because it showed me how important context is when analyzing data and how easy it could be to misinterpret data.
